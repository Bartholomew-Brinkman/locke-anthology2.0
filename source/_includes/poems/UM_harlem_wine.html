   This is not water running here,<br/>
   These thick rebellious streams<br/>
   That hurtle flesh and bone past fear<br/>
   Down alleyways of dreams.<br/>
   </p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="stanza">
   This is a wine that must flow on<br/>
   Not caring how or where,<br/>
   So it has ways to flow upon<br/>
   Where song is in the air.<br/>
   </p>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="stanza">
   So it can woo an artful flute<br/>
   With loose, elastic lips,<br/>
   Its measurement of joy compute<br/>
   With blithe, ecstatic hips.<br/>
