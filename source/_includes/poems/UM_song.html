<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="stanza">
   Lovely, dark, and lonely one,<br/>
   Bare your bosom to the sun,<br/>
   Do not be afraid of light<br/>
   You who are a child of night.<br/>
   Open wide your arms to life,<br/>
   Whirl in the wind of pain and strife,<br/>
   Face the wall with the dark closed gate,<br/>
   Beat with bare, brown fists<br/>
   And wait.<br/>
   </p>
