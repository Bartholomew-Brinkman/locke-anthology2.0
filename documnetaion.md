Imports Necessary Modules: It starts by importing necessary Node.js modules:

- fs for interacting with the file system (reading and writing files).
- path for handling file paths.
- jsdom for parsing and interacting with HTML content as if it were being processed in a web browser.
Defines the Poems Directory: It specifies the directory where the poem files are located ("./_includes/poems"). This is done using the path.join method to ensure the file path is correctly formatted across different operating systems.

Creates an Asynchronous Function (extractPoemAttributes): This function is designed to read the content of each HTML file in the specified poems directory, extract certain attributes from each poem, and then save these attributes into a JSON file.

Reads the Directory Contents: Inside the function, it first reads the names of all files in the poems directory using fs.readdirSync().

Iterates Through Each File: For every file found in the directory:

- It constructs the full path to the file.
- Reads the file's contents as a UTF-8 encoded string using fs.readFileSync().
- Parses the HTML content of the file using jsdom to create a JSDOM object, which simulates the document object model (DOM) of a webpage.
- Extracts Information from Each Poem: It looks for a <section> element in the HTML content (using querySelector('section')). If a <section> is found, it extracts:

The section's id attribute, which is used as the poem's title.
The section's class attribute, which is assumed to represent the poem's author.
Stores Poem Attributes: Each poem's title, author, and the file path are stored as an object in an array (poemAttributes).

Outputs and Saves the Extracted Information: After processing all files:

It logs the collected poem attributes to the console.
Saves the array of poem attributes to a file named poemAttributes.json in a pretty-printed format. This is accomplished through fs.writeFileSync().
Error Handling: The function includes a try-catch block to catch and log any errors that occur during the process, such as issues reading files.

Executes the Function: the script calls extractPoemAttributes() to execute the defined process.
